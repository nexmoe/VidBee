VidBee can watch RSS feeds and automatically queue new items for download. This is perfect for channels, playlists, or creators that publish regularly.

## Get an RSS feed URL

If you already have an RSS link, use it directly. If you do not have one, generate it with **RSSHub**:

1. Open the [RSSHub routes documentation](https://docs.rsshub.app/routes/) to browse available feed routes.
2. Find the platform you want to follow (YouTube, Twitter/X, etc.).
3. Fill in the required parameters and copy the generated feed URL.

### RSSHub Instances

Many RSSHub feeds use the `rsshub.app` domain, but the official instance is protected by Cloudflare. VidBee cannot directly access the official instance, so you'll need to use one of these alternatives:

- **Self-hosted RSSHub**: Deploy your own instance for reliable access
- **Public instances**: Check the [RSSHub instances guide](https://docs.rsshub.app/guide/instances) for a list of available public instances
- **Community instances**: Other users may have set up public instances you can access

Choose an instance that is reliable and accessible from your network.

## Add an RSS subscription

1. Open **VidBee → RSS**.
2. Click **Add RSS**.

3. Paste the RSS feed URL. VidBee will detect the feed automatically.
4. (Optional) Choose a **Custom directory** for downloads.
5. (Optional) Enable **Download only the latest video** if you only want the newest item.
6. (Optional) Open **Advanced Options** for:
   - **Keyword filter** (comma separated)
   - **Auto tags** (comma separated)
   - **Custom filename template** (yt-dlp style placeholders)
7. Click **Add** to save.

## What happens next

- VidBee checks the feed periodically and queues new items automatically.
- Items appear in the RSS list with their queue status.
- You can edit, refresh, disable, or remove subscriptions at any time.

## Troubleshooting

- **Feed URL invalid**: Verify the URL opens in a browser and returns RSS/Atom XML.
- **Duplicate feed**: Each RSS URL can only be subscribed once.
- **No new downloads**: Confirm the subscription is enabled and the feed has new items.
