Cookies reuse your browser's signed-in session so VidBee can download content that requires login or verification, such as subscriber-only items, age-gated pages, or private links.

## When you need cookies

- Content that requires an account to view or download.
- Age-gated or region-locked pages.
- Private links or lists visible only to signed-in users.

## Two ways to use cookies in VidBee

### Option 1: Read cookies from your browser

In **Settings**, select your browser. VidBee will try to detect the browser profile path automatically. You can also enter the profile path manually.

**Supported browsers (platform dependent):**

- **Windows: Firefox only. Other browsers cannot be used for cookie reading.**
- macOS: Safari, Chrome, Edge, Brave, Firefox, and more.
- Linux: Chrome, Chromium, Brave, Firefox, and more.

**Steps:**

1. Open VidBee → Settings → Cookies.
2. Select a browser and confirm the profile path.
3. Go back and start the download again.

If detection fails or the path is invalid, manually choose the actual browser profile directory.
On Windows, if you are not using Firefox, switch to the cookies file method.

### Option 2: Import a cookies file

You can import a **Netscape-formatted** cookies file. This is useful when reading the browser profile is not possible.

**Steps:**

1. Export a Netscape cookies file using a browser extension.
2. Open VidBee → Settings → Cookies file, and select the exported file.
3. Click Clear to disable it.

## Recommendations

- Prefer browser-based cookies when possible, because it's easier to maintain.
- If browser reading fails, switch to a cookies file.
- Cookies files expire. Re-export when your account state changes.

## Troubleshooting

- **Profile path is invalid**: Ensure the folder exists and points to the real browser profile directory.
- **Still asks for login**: Confirm your browser is signed in and re-save the setting.
- **Browser read failed**: Close the browser and retry, or switch to a cookies file.

## Privacy and security

Cookies are equivalent to your login session. Keep them private and never share or upload them. If you suspect leakage, sign out and change your password.
